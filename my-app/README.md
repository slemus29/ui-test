Solution Explanation

The interview test is built using the React library, it is lightweight compare to popular frameworks, the project was scaffolded with create-react-app due to its simplicity at creation time.

For styling sass was used, and Module components to use the styles as objects.

For the HTTP request I use the axios package.

I managed the store with redux, and the asyncronus call with react Thunk. In Each interection with the store, the store will be save in the localstorage.

Also in the Card component I used hocks to manage the internal state.
